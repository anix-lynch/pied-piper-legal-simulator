## 🎬 Example: "The Board Coup"

**Episode:** Raviga attempts to replace Richard as CEO

### VC Win Scenario 💰
> "VCs lock down board majority. Founders become employees of their own company. Like when Raviga tried to replace Richard - this is how they do it legally through board composition clauses."

**Clauses:**
- Board Composition: 3/5 seats controlled by investors
- Liquidation Preference: 2x participating preferred
- CEO Removal Rights: Board majority can remove founder

### Founder Win Scenario 💡
> "Founders secure board control with protective provisions. Dual-class shares keep voting power with Richard. This is the 'middle fingers up' moment - founders can't be voted out."

**Clauses:**
- Dual-Class Stock: 10x voting rights for founder shares
- Board Parity: 2-2 split + independent director
- Protective Provisions: Veto on CEO removal

### Win-Win Scenario 🤝
> "Board seats split evenly with independent tie-breaker. Both sides need to agree on major decisions. It's the fantasy scenario where everyone plays nice."

**Clauses:**
- Balanced Board: 3-3 + rotating chair
- Mutual Consent: Major decisions require both sides
- Milestone Triggers: Dilution tied to performance
